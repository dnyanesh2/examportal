Virtualization is software that separates physical infrastructures to create
various dedicated resources. It is the fundamental technology that powers
cloud computing.
The technology behind virtualization is known as a virtual machine monitor
(VMM) or virtual manager, which separates compute environments from the
actual physical infrastructure.
Virtualization makes servers, workstations, storage and other systems
independent of the physical hardware layer. This is done by installing a
Hypervisor on top of the hardware layer, where the systems are then installed.
There are three areas of IT where virtualization is making headroads, network
virtualization, storage virtualization and server virtualization.

Virtualization can be viewed as part of an overall trend in enterprise IT that
includes autonomic computing, a scenario in which the IT environment will be
able to manage itself based on perceived activity, and utility computing, in
which computer processing power is seen as a utility that clients can pay for
only as needed. The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative
tasks while improving scalability and work loads.
